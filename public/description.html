        <p>sTIME is an ongoing project in which time and subjectivity are placed in contrast with the aid of custom
            software; the artificial time is "translated" into the user/performer's subjective time, subverting the
            standardized time system that governs contemporary society.</p>
        <p>The project originated a few years ago when I heard the quote "Time is the intuition of ourselves and our
            inner
            space.", attributed to John Cage;</p>
        <p>It arose in me the need to create a system by which it was possible to transform the time external to us, if
            you
            like, artificial (aTIME), into personal time, by bringing a person's interior time outwards, thus
            translating
            objective time into subjective time (sTIME).</p>
        <p>For humans, the consciousness of time varies throughout life, not necessarily related to physics but
            undoubtedly evident to the senses. The school year days for a child seem very long compared to a year of
            life for an
            adult. This personal relativity also becomes variable from person to person.</p>
        <p>Therefore, each individual or group becomes an isolated system, with its clock unaffected by universal
            relativity. To measure this individual clock, which is not necessarily biological, but mental, I created
            sTIME.</p>
        <p>The software's operation is quite simple:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>When it starts, we see the hardware's artificial time (aTIME);</li>
            <li>Then, we have to press the screen for ten seconds, which we will count inside us;</li>
            <li>Based on these ten "inner" seconds, the clock will be set to our internal, subjective time (sTIME);</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For some, the time on their clock will run faster; for others slower; it will just keep showing us
            artificial
            time if it equals our personal time.</p>
